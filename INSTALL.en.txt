Installation Instructions

Instructions for installing the statistics on a game Windows server.

Important! If on the server is installed ROF Server Stats, the installation of this software may impair its performance.


1) Download and install PostgreSQL 9.5

2) Download and install Python 3.5 (In the options to choose - Add Python to PATH)
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2.exe


3) pgAdmin III installed with PostgreSQL - client to work with the database.
With the client you need to create a new database user (for example il2_stats).
Create a new database (eg il2_stats) and appoint its own user created earlier.
Run sql query into a new base for the enable of extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hstore;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;


4) Need to enable logging missions. In section KEY = system file startup.cfg need add
mission_text_log = 1
text_log_folder = "logs\txt\"

5) Configure the statistics through a file src/conf.ini

Statistics has a built-in web server. Its setting is a section of http.
With the default settings of web interface statistics will be available at http://127.0.0.1
Instead 127.0.0.1 can be an external IP address.
If the server is using firewall - it must be configured accordingly.

If the server is already use any other web server -  there are several options:
a) Run website statistics on a different port, for example 8000
b) Proxied requests from the primary Web server to web server statistics
c) Run website statistics with web server as a WSGI or FastCGI application. Used framework Django.

Database section need configure to access the PostgreSQL
Usually, it is enough to change the field name, user, password

You must specify the path to the directory where you installed the game server in game_server section - path

In the stats section are optional settings:
mission_report_delete - remove already processed logs (true / false)
mission_report_backup_days - the number of days to keep backup copies of the logs (they are stored in a packed zip file)
inactive_player_days - How many days a player must be out to statistics exclude it from the rankings
new_tour_by_month - activating automatic system tours by months (true / false)
win_by_score - Activation of calculating victory on scores in the mission if not victory by the completed task
win_score_min - the minimum number of scores for the coalition wins on scores
win_score_ratio - minimum ratio of two coalition scores to determine the winning coalition

6) Start run/install.cmd
- installs framework and libraries needed to run statistics
- creates tables in the database
- collect static files for the web
- imported into the database information about game objects
- offer to create an administrative user (path to admin panel - http://site_address/admin/)

7) If all done without error, installation is complete.
stats.cmd starts log parser
waitress.cmd starts the built-in web server

8) in the admin panel, section Chunks, you can change the server name
